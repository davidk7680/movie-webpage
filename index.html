  <h1>The Year of The L.A. Clippers</h1>
  <h2><i>Will this be the year that the clippers finally get their first championship after 46 years of dissapointment?</i></h2>
  <img src="Logo.png"></img>
  <p>Based on a true story, a young team coming out of Buffalo, NY hopes to seek a championship by moving to LA. After decades of playoff disappointments they rebuild their team off of talent and intelligence. They have assembled what seems to be the perfect team (with the exception of the small forward spot) with guys ranging from 40 year old veterans to 20 year old rookies, and also championship coaches. <span class="strong">The CLIPPERS ARE READY!</span></p>
