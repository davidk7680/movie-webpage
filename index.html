      <p id ="background">Based on a true story, a young team coming out of Buffalo, NY hopes to seek a championship by moving to LA. After decades of cursed draft picks and recent playoff disappointments they have got rid of a racsict team owner (Donald Sterling) and rebuit their team off of talent, athelticsism, hardwork and intelligence. They have assembled what seems to be the perfect team (with the exception of the small forward spot) with guys ranging from 40 year old veterans to 20 year old rookies, and also championship coaches. They have players ranging from 3-point sharpshooters to ferocious dunkers to brilliant passers to deadly ball handlers. The question is will this be enough be for them to finally get out of the 2nd round, make into the Western Conference and NBA finals, and win it all?</p>
